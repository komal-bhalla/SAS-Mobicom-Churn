Company Information

Mobicom is a leading telecommunications provider. The company earns most of its revenue by providing mobile and Wireless Internet services. Based on the past and current customer information, the company has maintained a database containing personal/demographic information, and the services availed by a customer.

Problem Statement

Senior management at Mobicom is concerned that the market environment of rising churn rates and declining ARPU will hit them even harder as churn rate at Mobicom is relatively high. 
The current focus is to roll out targeted proactive retention programs, which include usage enhancing marketing programs to increase minutes of usage (MOU), rate plan migration, and a bundling strategy among others.  To be able to effectively drive these retention strategies, a few key questions of interest require urgent attention.

Top Line Questions of Interest to Senior Management:

(a)What are the top five factors driving likelihood of churn at Mobicom?

(b)Validation of survey findings. a) Whether “cost and billing” and “network and service quality” are important factors influencing churn behaviour.  b) Are data usage connectivity issues turning out to be costly? In other words, is it leading to churn?

(c)Would you recommend rate plan migration as a proactive retention strategy?

(d)What would be your recommendation on how to use this churn model for prioritisation of customers for a proactive retention campaigns in the future?

(e)What would be the target segments for proactive retention campaigns? Falling ARPU forecast is also a concern and therefore, Mobicom would like to save their high revenue customers besides managing churn. Given a budget constraint of a contact list of 20% of the subscriber pool, which subscribers should prioritized if “revenue saves” is also a priority besides controlling churn. In other words, controlling churn is the primary objective and revenue saves is the secondary objective.
